# Kokoro Speech Dataset

Kokoro Speech Dataset is a public domain Japanese speech dataset.
It contains 34,958 short audio clips of a single speaker reading 9 novel books.
The format of the metadata is similar to that of
[LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) so that the dataset is compatible
with modern speech synthesis systems.

The texts are from 
[Aozora Bunko](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/),
which are the public domain. The audio clips
are from
[LibriVox project](https://librivox.org/),
which are also in the public domain.
Readings are estimated by 
[MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/)
and
[UniDic Lite](https://pypi.org/project/unidic-lite/)
from Kanji-Kana mixture text.
Readings are in romanized text
which is similar to the format used by
[Julius](https://github.com/julius-speech/julius).

The audio clips were split and transcripts were aligned automatically by
[Voice100](https://github.com/kaiidams/voice100).

## Sample data

[Listen](https://kaiidams.github.io/Kokoro-Speech-Dataset/samples.html)
from your browser or download
[randomly sampled 100 clips](https://github.com/kaiidams/Kokoro-Speech-Dataset/releases/download/1.0/kokoro-sample-v1_0.zip).

## File Format

Metadata is provided in `metadata.csv`. This file consists of one record per line,
delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

- ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
- Transcription: Kanji-kana mixture text spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
- Reading: Romanized text spoken by the reader (UTF-8)

Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of 22050 Hz.

## Statistics

The dataset is provided with different sizes, `large`, `small`, `tiny`. `small` and `tiny`
don't share same clips. `large` contains all available clips, including `small` and `tiny`.

```
Large:
Total clips: 34958
Min duration: 3.007 secs
Max duration: 14.745 secs
Mean duration: 4.978 secs
Total duration: 48:20:24

Small:
Total clips: 8812
Min duration: 3.007 secs
Max duration: 14.431 secs
Mean duration: 4.951 secs
Total duration: 12:07:12

Tiny:
Total clips: 285
Min duration: 3.019 secs
Max duration: 9.462 secs
Mean duration: 4.871 secs
Total duration: 00:23:08
```

## How to get the data

Because of its large data size of the dataset, audio files are not
included in this repository, but the metadata are included.

To get all WAV files of the dataset, run 

```
$ download.sh
```

to download the metadata from the project page. Then run

```
$ pip install torchaudio
$ python extract.py --size tiny
```

this shows a shell script example to download MP3 audio files
from archive.org and extract them if you haven't done it already.

After doing so, run the command again

```
$ python extract.py --size tiny
```

to get files for the `tiny` set under `./output` directory. You can
give another size name to the `--size` options to get dataset of 
the size.

## Pretrained Tacotron model

Pretrained [Tacotron](https://github.com/keithito/tacotron)
model trained with Kokoro Speech Dataset
and audio samples are available.
The model was trained for 21K steps with the small set.
According to the Tacotron author,
"Speech started to become intelligible around 20K steps" with
LJ Speech Dataset.
Audio samples reads the first few sentences from Gon Gitsune
which is not included in the small set.
